## Addressing Build Time Accuracy in Marketing Materials

Concerns were raised about discrepancies between build times advertised in social media posts and actual build times displayed in screenshots. Specifically, an initial social post claimed "build time down to 1s," while the accompanying screenshot showed a longer duration.

The build time representation in the blog post was adjusted for clarity. To address the discrepancy between promotional materials and actual build times:

*   The initial claim of "roughly 1 second" in the blog post was reviewed and revised.
*   A new screenshot reflecting a more accurate build time was incorporated into the blog post.

The strategy is for social media posts to attract attention, while the blog post presents accurate information with a correct image.
