**Keywords:** Develocity, IntelliJ, plugin, Gradle, build time, optimization, Build Scan

## Overview

This article discusses the Develocity IntelliJ plugin, focusing on understanding and optimizing Gradle build times within the IDE. It addresses the plugin's features, setup instructions, and potential discrepancies in reported build times as highlighted in the associated blog post and social media promotions.

## Key Features and Benefits of the Develocity IntelliJ Plugin

The Develocity IntelliJ plugin aims to improve developer productivity by providing insights into Gradle builds directly within the IntelliJ IDE.  Benefits include:

*   Directly mapping troubleshooting value to developer productivity and satisfaction.
*   Simplified setup instructions for new users.
*   Integration with Build Scan for in-depth build analysis.

## Understanding Build Time in the Plugin

The plugin provides information about the time taken to complete specific tasks during the build process. Accuracy in representing these times is crucial for user trust and effective optimization efforts.

## Addressing Discrepancies in Build Time Reporting

It is important to ensure the build times displayed in promotional materials (blog posts, social media) accurately reflect the times presented within the plugin itself. Discrepancies can lead to confusion and undermine the plugin's credibility. When reporting build times, it may be appropriate to use terms like "roughly X seconds" to account for minor variations.

## Image Usage in Promotional Materials

Social media images should be visually appealing to draw user attention to the Develocity IntelliJ plugin. However, the image should accurately reflect the information presented in the full blog post. The blog post itself should strive for complete accuracy. If updates are required, the blog post should be updated first.
