# Understanding Memory Usage in Dockerized JVM Applications

**Keywords:** docker, jvm, memory, resource-usage, heap, metaspace

## Overview

This article clarifies how memory is reported and managed when running a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) application within a Docker container. It addresses common discrepancies between reported memory figures and explains factors that contribute to memory usage.

## Understanding Total Memory within Docker

The total memory reported *within* a Docker container does **not** represent the memory limit imposed on the container. Instead, it reflects the total physical memory of the host machine on which the Docker container is running.

## Resource Usage Insights vs. JVM Heap Memory

The memory captured via resource usage insights represents the *reserved* memory allocated to the JVM process by the operating system. This is distinct from the JVM heap memory reported on performance overview pages. The JVM utilizes additional memory beyond the heap, including:

*   **Metaspace:** Stores class metadata.
*   **Other non-heap memory:** Used for various JVM internal operations.

Therefore, it is expected that the total memory used by the JVM (as reported by operating system tools) will be larger than the JVM heap size.

## Operating System's Role in Memory Management

The heap memory used by the JVM can sometimes appear to be *larger* than the reserved memory reported by resource usage insights. This is because the operating system may employ techniques such as:

*   **Memory Compression:** Reducing the physical memory footprint of processes.
*   **Swapping:** Moving less frequently used memory pages to disk.

These OS-level optimizations can cause the observed memory usage to deviate from the reserved memory values.
