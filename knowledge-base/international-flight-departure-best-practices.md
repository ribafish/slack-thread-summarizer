# International Flight Departure Best Practices

**Keywords:** international flights, passport control, airport security, Schengen area, departure planning

## Overview

This article outlines best practices for planning international flight departures, focusing on passport control queues and reliance on airport displays. It provides guidelines to minimize delays and ensure a smooth departure experience.

## Passport Control Queue Timing

When departing from an airport in the Schengen area to a destination outside of it, allocate sufficient time for passport control. The passport control queue can be lengthy, particularly in Lisbon. While Porto's queue is usually shorter, it's recommended to allow at least one hour for passport control at either airport to account for potential delays. This guideline primarily applies to non-EU passport holders using the "All passports" queue.

## Airport Display Reliability

Airport displays may not provide real-time updates on flight status. Do not solely rely on these displays for boarding information. Proceed to the gate as soon as possible after check-in to avoid missing the flight, even if the display indicates otherwise. It is best practice to proactively check the gate status and ensure timely arrival at the gate regardless of display information.

## Collaborative Departure Planning

To facilitate efficient departure planning and carpooling, consider using a shared document to record departure times.
